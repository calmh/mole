<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>Mole is an <code>ssh</code> tunnel manager with sweet features for teams and a thick layer
of pure awesome.</p>

<p>It's based around <em>tunnel definitions</em> which are self contained recipes that
describe how to connect to a customer or site.  A tunnel definition contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>One or more host definitions (name, address, username).</li>
<li>A password or SSH key for the host. This is not optional, tunnel
definitions should be able to connect without user interaction.</li>
<li>A description of how to chain the hosts together to reach the final
destination, i.e. jump via host A to B, from B to C and from there to D.</li>
<li>A set of port forwarding descriptions to set up once the destination is
reached, with commentary on what they're for.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tunnel definitions live server side with a local cache and are pushed and
pulled similarly to how a DVCS works. If you don't know about that you don't
need to care, just know that <code>mole pull</code> will grab any new tunnel definitions
from the server and store them in the local cache.</p>

<p>All server communication is certificate authenticated and secured by TLS.</p>

<p>The end result of all this is that as long as you have mole installed and
someone has written a tunnel definition, you can just <code>mole dig foobar</code> to
connect all the way and get a nice list of available port forwardings presented
to you.</p>
