most new features.

   github.com/mavricknz/asn1-ber

Working:
   Connecting to LDAP server
   Binding to LDAP server
   Searching for entries

      Can perform multiple search requests at the same time and return
         the results to the proper goroutine.  All requests are blocking
         requests, so the goroutine does not need special handling
